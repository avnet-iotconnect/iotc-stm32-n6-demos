## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the steps of setting up the STM32N6570-DK with Avnet's /IOTCONNECT platform.  The QuickStart demonstrates ST's edge AI object detection model to 
provide object coordinates information to /IOTCONNECT.

## 2. Prerequisites
This guide has been written and tested with the hardware and software listed below, but may work with other environments with some modifications.

### Hardware
* PC with Windows 10/11
* 2x USB Type-C data cables
* 4x Male to Female header jumpers [Buy from Newark](https://www.newark.com/multicomp-pro/mp006283/jumper-wire-kit-male-to-female/dp/15AJ6557)
* /IOTCONNECT enabled wireless PMOD Board (eg [DA16200](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/renesas-electronics/us159-da16200mevz-3074457345649323747) or [DA16600](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/renesas-electronics/us159-da16600evz-3074457345649323748))

### Software
* A serial terminal application such as [Tera Term](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tera-term/) (Recommended) or a browser-based version such as [Google Chrome Labs Serial Terminal](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/serial-terminal/)
* [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) (A free [MyST](https://my.st.com/cas/login) account is required to download)
* Download and unzip the pre-compiled firmware [n6uvc-binary.zip](https://downloads.iotconnect.io/partners/st/demos/uvc/n6uvc-binary.zip) to a location near the root of your drive.

## 3. STM32N6 Hardware Setup
* Connect the camera via the white ribbon cable to the board (the blue stripe should be facing up on both ends).
* Connect two USB type-C cables from each side of the board to the PC.
* Change the Power Select Header (JMP2) from the 1-2 position to the 3-4 position to allow power delivery from both USB-C ports.

## 4. Programming the board
### 4.1 Prepare the Board
* Move the **BOOT1** switch to the right position to enter the "Development Boot" mode.
* Press the **RESET** button.

### 4.2 Setup the Programmer
* Launch the STM32CubeProgrammer.
* In the left menu, click the "External loaders" (EL).
* Use the search box to find "STM32N6570-DK" and select the check box to the left.
* In the upper right corner, change the connection type to "ST-LINK".
* Just below, change the ST-LINK configuration Mode to "Hot Plug"
* Click "Connect"

### 4.3 Program the Binaries
* In the left menu, click the "Erasing & programming".
#### 4.3.1 Program Bootloader
The **Bootloader** initializes the hardware, validates the firmware the enforces secure boot.
* Click "Browse" and navigate to and select `ai_fsbl.hex` previously extracted.
* Click "Start Programming" and wait until complete.
#### 4.3.2 Program the AI Model
The **AI Model** contains optimized model data for Neural-ART accelerator.
* Click "Browse" and navigate to and select `network_data.hex` previously extracted.
* Click "Start Programming" and wait until complete.
#### 4.3.3 Program the Application
The **Application** implements the core functionalities of the demo such as the AI inference and camera processing.  This is a custom signed image of the UVC application.
* Click "Browse" and navigate to and select `uvc_signed.bin` previously extracted.
* In the "Start Address" field, copy/paste the following address:
```
0x70100000
```
* Click "Start Programming" and wait until complete.
* Move the **BOOT1** switch back to the left position to boot from the External Flash we just programmed.
* **Disconnect** and **Close** the programmer.
* Press the **RESET** button.

## 5. Cloud Account Setup
An /IOTCONNECT account with AWS backend is required.  If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is available.

[/IOTCONNECT Free Trial (AWS Version)](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws)

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

See the /IOTCONNECT [Subscription Information](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/subscription.md) for more details on the trial.

## 6. Create a Device Template in /IOTCONNECT
A Device Template defines the type of telemetery the platform should expect to receive.
* Download the premade device template [n6uvc_template.JSON](n6uvc_template.JSON?raw=1) (**MUST** Right-Click and "Save-As" to get the raw json file)
* Log-in the [console.iotconnect.io](https://console.iotconnect.io/login) using the credentials received when registering. 
* Import the template into your /IOTCONNECT instance. (A guide on [Importing a Device Template](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/import_device_template.md) is available or for more information, please see the [/IOTCONNECT Documentation](https://docs.iotconnect.io/iotconnect/) website.)

## 7. Create a Device /IOTCONNECT
1.  **Click** the Device icon and the "Device" sub-menu
2. At the top-right, click on the "Create Device" button
3. Enter `MySTN6` for both **Unique ID** and **Device Name**
4. Select the entity in the drop-down (if this is a new/trial account, there is only one option)
5. Select the template ("n6uvc") from the template dropdown box
6. Leave the Device Certificate as "Auto-generated"
7. Click Save & View
9. Click the link for "Connection Info" and then the icon in the top-right and save the file "MySTN6-certificates.zip" into your working directory.

## 8. Obtain /IOTCONNECT Connection Info
* The Company ID (**CPID**) and Environment (**ENV**) variables identifying your unique /IOTCONNECT account will be used to instruct the PMOD how to connect to the platform. This information is located in the "Settings" -> "Key Vault" section of the platform.
* Copy these two values for use in the next section.
  
## 9. Flash/Configure the DA16k PMOD module
Follow the instructions in the [DA16K QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-dialog-da16k-sdk/blob/main/doc/QUICKSTART.md) to flash the DA16k PMOD then return to this guide.  This guide will walk through flashing the PMOD and entering the /IOTCONNECT information to connect to the platform.


## 10. Run the Applicaton
* Power off the board by unplugging the USB cables.
* Connect the DA16k PMOD module to the board's STMod+ Connector via the male-to-female jumper wires. (See the [STMod+ Technical note](https://www.st.com/resource/en/technical_note/tn1238-stmod-interface-specification-stmicroelectronics.pdf) and the [Digilent Pmodâ„¢ Interface Specification](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/pmod/pmod-interface-specification-1_2_0.pdf) for more information on pinouts).

| PMOD pin # | STMOD+ pin # |             
|:----------:|:------------:| 
|   2 (RX)   | 2 (UARTy_TX) | 
|   3 (TX)   | 3 (UARTy_RX) | 
|  5 (GND)   |   16 (GND)   |
|  6 (+5v)   |   6 (+5v)    |

* Connect the USB cables to the board.
* Launch the host camera application. (ex. N6CamViwer or ffplay)

> [!NOTE]
> The video stream needs to be playing for the inferencing to be enabled.

## 11. Dashboard Setup and Usage
* Download the [Dashboard Template](TBD)
