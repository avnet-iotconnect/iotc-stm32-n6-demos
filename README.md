This repo outlines the steps of setting up the STM32N6570-DK board with Avnet's /IOTCONNECT.  The solution leverages ST's object detection models to
provide object coordinates information to /IOTCONNECT platform.

It's recommended to first reivew the [QuickStart](./doc/QUICKSTART.md) before moving onto the [DEVELOPER GUIDE](./doc/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).
